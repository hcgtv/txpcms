# [TXP CMS](http://txpcms.com)

TXP CMS is being based on the Textpattern CMS project.

Modification is allowed by the GPL license, this signals our intent to alter 
the code base to suite our specific objectives.

We owe everything to those who have faithfully kept the Textpattern core, 
one of the fastest PHP rendering engines for the past 10 years.

## The Plan

The plan is to revamp the admin using Bootstrap as the framework.

* This will bring a fresh new look and feel to the backend, while adding mobile 
responsiveness as an added bonus.

* Theming will be first and foremost in these changes, bringing easier methods 
to work with the presentation.

* This is more than an admin skin, it's a rethinking of the admin, while keeping 
the core true to Textpattern.

Git is being used locally to track changes, commits to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/u/hcgtv) when we're ready.
